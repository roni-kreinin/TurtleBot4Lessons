# Unit 0, Lesson 3: Finding Help

### Lesson Objectives 

* Remember that robotics is hard. You will get stuck. You will make mistakes.
* Being able to quickly find help for your problems is crucial skill. 
* The objective for this lesson is to introduce the resources available for ROS.
* You should bookmark all of these websites in your browser. 


## ROS Discourse

![Discourse](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/osrf/TurtleBot4Lessons/main/media/discourse.png?token=GHSAT0AAAAAABQJBI4R3NBN6D6RVUL6XO5EYQMGQ7Q)


* [ROS Discourse](http://discourse.ros.org) is the official ROS discussion forum. 
* ROS Discourse is intended for community announcements and discussion.
  * **ROS Discourse should not be used for specific development questions.**
* On ROS Discourse you find.
  * Announcements of new packages and package releases.
  * Announcements of ROS releases and updates.
  * Technical discussions by package developers. 
  * Event announcments.
  * Regular news updates. 
  * Meet other ROS developers and package maintainers. 

## ROS 2 Documetation 

![ROS 2 Documentation](https://github.com/osrf/TurtleBot4Lessons/blob/main/media/rosdocs.png?raw=true)


* [The ROS 2 Docs](http://docs.ros.org) are the official ROS documentation pages. 
* The ROS 2 Docs provide detailed API level documentation, tutorials, and examples. 
* This is your best bet for comprehensive ROS information. 
* Make sure you are viewing the correct documentation for your ROS version. 
* Many other packages have documentation under the `*.ros.org` umbrella org. 
  * [navigation.ros.org](https://navigation.ros.org/) -- the Nav2 documentation.
  * [moveit.ros.org](https://moveit.ros.org/) -- MoveIt 2 documentation.
  * [micro.ros.org](https://micro.ros.org/) -- the micro-ROS documentation.
* Some packages maintain their own documentation from their own repository or website (e.g. [SMACC](https://smacc.dev/)).
* Other packages may be linked to from within the ROS 2 docs. These are available under [related projects.](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/Related-Projects.html)


## ROS Answers

![ROS Answers](https://github.com/osrf/TurtleBot4Lessons/blob/main/media/answers.png?raw=true)


* [ROS Answers](http://answers.ros.org) are the official ROS Q&A Website. 
* ROS Answers is a Q&A website where users post questions that are answered by the community
* Fun fact: ROS Answers was started roughly at the same time as Stack Overflow! 
* Make sure to tag your question appropriately.
* **Please search for your question before asking it!**
* ROS Answers is maintained by volunteers and community members, please be considerate!

## Help Others Help You

* Writing a good question is a critical to getting a good response.
* Generally speaking, the shorter the question, the less likely it is to be answered. 
* Longer, more complete questions, that provide all the necessary information, allow others to more easily help you. 
* A good ROS question should contain:
  * The body of question with as much detail as possible. 
  * General details about your system, such as host operating system, the version of ROS, and what packages you have installed.
  * The error message in its entirety. This should be quoted text and not a screenshot,
  * References to documentation, resources, and other questions you have tried but did not work. 
* Distinguish between a discussion questions, poorly scoped questions, and legitimate errors and issues. 
  * A discussion question is one where there is no single correct answer.
    * Questions like, "What is the best...", or "How should I make X?" are discussion questions.
  * A poorly scoped question is one where the response could be multiple paragraphs long. These sort of questions need to broken down into smaller parts.
    * Questions like, "How do I build a delta robot in ROS?" or "How do I build a perception pipeline to find X?" are poorly scoped.
  * Legitimate errors and issues are usually easily described. 
    * Questions like, "When I do X, Y error occurs" or "When I use X, I expect Y but get Z, why is this?"


## ROS Index

![ROS Index](https://github.com/osrf/TurtleBot4Lessons/blob/main/media/index.png?raw=true)


* [ROS Index](http://index.ros.org) is a non-exhaustive list of ROS packages.
* ROS Index will allow you to search packages by name and see relevant information about the supported distros, source repositories, documentation, and lots of other information.
* ROS Index is a great place to find out about commonly used packages. 
* Most common packages are availabe on ROS index and its search features are quite helpful.

# Turtle Bot 4 -- A Fancy Robot

* Let's learn about robots!

## This Is A Presentation Section Page

![A TurtleBot 4](../media/tb4.png)

* Today we will learn how to use a TurtleBot 4

### This Is A Bulleted List on TB4 Resources

* One
  * One A
  * One B
* Two
   * foo
   * bar
   * baz
   
** Here are some slide notes. Note you leave an empty line between the content - in this case a bulleted list - and the notes. **


## Here is a page with some code!

* For help search [Google](http://www.google.com). 
* `This is highlighted code`
** This is emphasis code. ** 

```
      sudo apt update
      sudo apt install -y python3-rosdep
      sudo rosdep init
      rosdep update
```

* This is some text describing above

### Here is another page

* Herp
* Derp
* Slerp
* Perp

** WILL THIS TEXT SHOW UP? **

## How about an image and code 

![A TurtleBot 4](../media/tb4.png)

```
      sudo apt update
      sudo apt install -y python3-rosdep
      sudo rosdep init
      rosdep update
```

## How about an image and text???

#### This slide is an image and text! This text won't appear

* This text will appear!
* So will this
* So will this?

## What about tables?

| a | b | c | d | e |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 3 | 4 |
| a | f | g | d | s |
| s | s | s | s | s |


__This is a underlined under a table__

# Do we get syntax highlighting

```
    def sortedNumericList(string):
        return sorted(list(map(int, set(string.split()))))

    def parseRGB(str):
        if RGBmatch := RGBRegex.match(str):
            # Matches
            return (True, RGBmatch.group(1))
        else:
            return (False, "")
```

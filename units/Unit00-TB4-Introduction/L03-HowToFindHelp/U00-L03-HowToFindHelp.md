# Unit 0, Lesson 3: Finding Help

### Lesson Objectives 

* Remember that robotics is hard. You will get stuck. You will make mistakes.
* Being able to quickly find help for your problems is crucial skill. 
* The objective for this lesson is to introduce the resources available for ROS.
* You should bookmark all of these websites in your browser. 


## ROS Discourse

![Discourse](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/osrf/TurtleBot4Lessons/main/media/discourse.png?token=GHSAT0AAAAAABQJBI4R3NBN6D6RVUL6XO5EYQMGQ7Q)


* [ROS Discourse](http://discourse.ros.org) is the official ROS discussion forum. 
* ROS Discourse is intended for community announcements and discussion.
  * **ROS Discourse should not be used for specific development questions.**
* On ROS Discourse you find.
  * Announcements of new packages and package releases.
  * Announcements of ROS releases and updates.
  * Technical discussions by package developers. 
  * Event announcements.
  * Regular news updates. 
  * Meet other ROS developers and package maintainers. 

## ROS 2 Documentation 

![ROS 2 Documentation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/osrf/TurtleBot4Lessons/main/media/rosdocs.png?token=GHSAT0AAAAAABQJBI4RE2MCYQ53KDG3AU3GYQMLUWA)


* [The ROS 2 Docs](http://docs.ros.org) are the official ROS documentation pages. 
* The ROS 2 Docs provide detailed API level documentation, tutorials, and examples. 
* This is your best bet for comprehensive ROS information. 
* Make sure you are viewing the correct documentation for your ROS version. 
* Many other packages have documentation under the `*.ros.org` umbrella org. 
  * [navigation.ros.org](https://navigation.ros.org/) -- the Nav2 documentation.
  * [moveit.ros.org](https://moveit.ros.org/) -- MoveIt 2 documentation.
  * [micro.ros.org](https://micro.ros.org/) -- the micro-ROS documentation.
* Some packages maintain their own documentation from their own repository or website (e.g. [SMACC](https://smacc.dev/)).
* Other packages may be linked to from within the ROS 2 docs. These are available under [related projects.](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/Related-Projects.html)


## ROS Answers

![ROS Answers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/osrf/TurtleBot4Lessons/main/media/answers.png?token=GHSAT0AAAAAABQJBI4RSUDUPKGWMKPHZ66YYQNRAAA)


* [ROS Answers](http://answers.ros.org) are the official ROS Q&A Website. 
* ROS Answers is a Q&A website where users post questions that are answered by the community
* Fun fact: ROS Answers was started roughly at the same time as Stack Overflow! 
* Make sure to tag your question appropriately.
* **Please search for your question before asking it!**
* ROS Answers is maintained by volunteers and community members, please be considerate!
* [The ROS 2 doctor CLI app](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Tutorials/Getting-Started-With-Ros2doctor.html) can be used to quickly generate a report about your system. We'll cover this function in later classes.  

## Help Others Help You

* Writing a good question is a critical to getting a good response.
* Generally speaking, the shorter the question, the less likely it is to be answered. 
* Longer, more complete questions, that provide all the necessary information, allow others to more easily help you. 
* A good ROS question should contain:
  * The body of question with as much detail as possible. 
  * General details about your system, such as host operating system, the version of ROS, and what packages you have installed.
  * The error message in its entirety. This should be quoted text and not a screenshot,
  * References to documentation, resources, and other questions you have tried but did not work. 
* Distinguish between a discussion questions, poorly scoped questions, and legitimate errors and issues. 
  * A discussion question is one where there is no single correct answer.
    * Questions like, "What is the best...", or "How should I make X?" are discussion questions.
  * A poorly scoped question is one where the response could be multiple paragraphs long. These sort of questions need to broken down into smaller parts.
    * Questions like, "How do I build a delta robot in ROS?" or "How do I build a perception pipeline to find X?" are poorly scoped.
  * Legitimate errors and issues are usually easily described. 
    * Questions like, "When I do X, Y error occurs" or "When I use X, I expect Y but get Z, why is this?"


## ROS Index

![ROS Index](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/osrf/TurtleBot4Lessons/main/media/index.png?token=GHSAT0AAAAAABQJBI4QEFDR6HIPMMWINO5KYQNQ6AA)


* [ROS Index](http://index.ros.org) is a non-exhaustive list of ROS packages.
* ROS Index will allow you to search packages by name and see relevant information about the supported distros, source repositories, documentation, and lots of other information.
* ROS Index is a great place to find out about commonly used packages. 
* Most common packages are available on ROS index and its search features are quite helpful. 

## ROS Wiki

![ROS Wiki](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/osrf/TurtleBot4Lessons/main/media/wiki.png?token=GHSAT0AAAAAABQJBI4RDKVHH7G5N5MVI4LMYQNQ7RA)

* The ROS Wiki is a collection of primarily **ROS 1** tutorials and resources.
* While the wiki is primarily ROS 1 resources it still highly useful for new ROS 2 users.
* We suggest browsing the wiki but heed its advice with a grain of salt!

# Thoughts on Problem Solving

![Problem Solving](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/Thinking-Aloud_Pair_Problem_Solving.png/800px-Thinking-Aloud_Pair_Problem_Solving.png)

* Debugging is an important skill for software developers but it takes years to master. 
* We recommend the `three then me` approach to debugging, where the me refers to another person.
* Broadly, this means you should try using at least three resources before asking another human for help. 
* For example, if you encounter an error building a ROS package you should first:
  * Search for the error using a search engine and look at the results.
  * Compare the offending code against its API documentation. 
  * Search Github for the function and see how others use it. 
  * If none of these approaches are fruitful, ask another person or post your question to a forum. 
* One often overlooked developer resource are unit tests; for a given library the unit tests will show the function being used correctly.
* Searching Github for a function call is often another way to find useful examples. 
* Good git practice also helps! You should compile, test, and commit your code often, generally every time you write a function.
  * If you encounter an error that you can't solve use `git stash` to return to your last commit and systematically eliminate possible causes.

# Unit 0, Lesson 1: Ignition Blastoff

### Lesson Objectives 

* Learn what a simulation is in the context of robotics.
* Learn what Ignition is and where it came from. 
* Select the appropriate installation procedure your computer
* Setup the Ignition and TurtleBot4 simulation for Ignition
* Understand the steps involved in the setup process
* Learn basic controls for both Ignition and TurtleBot. 



### What is a Simulation?

![The Matrix](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/Matrix-plano_subjetivo.jpg?20211216120933)

* A simulation is a virtual world that includes a subset of features from the real world. 
* In the context of robotics, simulations are virtual worlds that allow roboticists to be more productive.
* Simulations are very similar to modern video games in that they include realistic physics simulations, a notion of time, and graphical representations of the real world.
* A second way to think of a simulation is a robot's imagination. Your robot can experience a particular scenario and try different approaches to solve a problem. 
* Simulations are also a productivity tool for roboticists; making it easier to perform a variety of tasks. 

### Why Do We Use Simulation?

* It is often said that robots are best suited to dull, dirty, and dangerous tasks, and by extension so is the process of developing a robot. 
* A simulation allows a robot developer to increase their productivity in a variety of ways.
  * With a simulation you can create a arbitrary number of robots and put them an arbitrary number of scenarios, without worrying about costs. 
  * Working on robots can get dirty. Simulations allow us to work from our desks.
  * Robots can be dangerous! It is much safer to test your algorithms in simulation before applying them to a real robot. 
  * Simulation is cost effective. Building a gaming computer is much cheaper than building a robot from scratch.
* Simulation has become ubiquitous in the field of robotics. Competitions like DARPA SubT, NIST ARIAC, VRX, and many others now use simulation for robotics competitions. 


### What is Ignition?

![Ignition Logo](https://ignitionrobotics.org/assets/images/logos/ignition_logo_color_horizontal.svg)

* Ignition, is a collection of simulation software maintained by the same group that maintains ROS, Open Robotics.
* At its core Ignition consists of game engine, a physics engine, a plug-in library, and the infrastructure necessary to interface ROS.
* Ignition is latest incarnation of the Gazebo simulator. Ignition is to Gazebo as ROS 1 is to ROS 2
* The Ignition simulator is called Ignition Gazebo, while the other software tools are referred to as Ignition.
* Ignition supports a number of infrastructure tools that support developers:
  * [Ignition Fuel](https://app.ignitionrobotics.org/fuel) -- A collection of drag-and-drop 3D assets and environments for scenario development.
  * [Cloud Sim](https://gitlab.com/ignitionrobotics/web/cloudsim) -- A tool for running simulations on a cloud instance
  * [SDFormat](http://sdformat.org/spec) -- A specification for creating rich simulation elements.

### Installing Ignition Fortress


![Ignition Fortess Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/osrf/TurtleBot4Lessons/main/media/fortress.jpg?token=GHSAT0AAAAAABQJBI4RQAB5ABAKPJV47E3QYQVLMFA)

* Just like ROS, Ignition has a yearly release where odd year releases are considered long term support (LTS) releases. 
* The TurtleBot4 Simulation use the Ignition Fortress LTS release.
* [The full installtion notes for Ignition Fortress can be found on the Ignition Website.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/osrf/TurtleBot4Lessons/main/media/fortress.jpg?token=GHSAT0AAAAAABQJBI4RQAB5ABAKPJV47E3QYQVLMFA)
* Ignition, like ROS 2, is free and open source software, and you should be able to run it on most systems, but that doesn't mean it works perfectly on every computer! 
* Due to frequent changes in the software libraries used in Ignition, not every operating system will have binary packages for Download.
* If your host OS is listed in the installation notes you should be able to install Fortress natively; otherwise we recommend that you install Fortress in a virtual machine. 

### Installing Ignition Fortress II

| Host OS |Recommended Installation |Configuration|Note|
| Ubuntu 20.04   | [Standard Install](https://ignitionrobotics.org/docs/fortress/install_ubuntu)          | Binary / Apt    | **Recommended **              |
| Ubuntu < 20.04 | [VM with Ubuntu 20.04](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)                      | VM              | ROS 2 H/G Requires 20.04      |
| Other Linux    | [VM with Ubuntu 20.04](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)                      | VM              | Binary installation possible  |

## Installing A Virtual Machine

![VM](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a2/VirtualBox_Guest_Additions_Logo_2010.png)

* As you can see from the chart above most host operating sytems will require a virtual machine. 
* While ROS and Igntion *can* run on a wide variety of operating systems many of them require compilation from source code.
  * New users often run in to difficulties compiling from source. This is why we recommend a virtual machine. 
* While a container is also a possible solution we recommend a VM as they are usually easier to navigate for new users. 
* We recommend VirtualBox, but VMWare or any other VM client should work. 
* The steps for VM installation are as follows:
  * [Install the VM Client for your host system.](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
  * [Create a new Virtual Machine and Install Ubuntu 20.04](https://linuxhint.com/install_ubuntu_virtualbox_2004/)
  * [Start the VM and follow Ubuntu 20.04 Installation](https://ignitionrobotics.org/docs/fortress/install_ubuntu)

## Installing Ignition

* For the rest of the lesson we'll assume you are running Ubuntu 20.04. 
* The next step is to install the Ignition Fortress binaries.
* Installation process is simple:
  * Install tools
  * Add GPG key for apt repositories
  * Update package list
  * Install Binaires
* Apt is the Ubuntu installation tool, it is like an app-store for Linux.
* Open a terminal and run the following commands (Window-Ket+terminal):

```
sudo apt-get install lsb-release wget gnupg
sudo wget https://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo.gpg -O /usr/share/keyrings/pkgs-osrf-archive-keyring.gpg

echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) \
	signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/pkgs-osrf-archive-keyring.gpg] \
	http://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo/ubuntu-stable \
	$(lsb_release -cs) main" | \
	sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/gazebo-stable.list \
	> /dev/null
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ignition-fortress
```
## Fire up Ignition

![Shapes Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/osrf/TurtleBot4Lessons/main/media/shapes.png?token=GHSAT0AAAAAABQJBI4QEDZJK4WCWAA5KGPUYQVO7EQ)

* If everything installed correctly you can now start Ignition.
* Open a terminal and type the command `ign gazebo shapes.sdf`.
* If everything worked you should see the image 


## Installing Simulation Dependencies

``` 
pip install colcon-common-extensions
pip install rosdep
pip install vcstool
```

* The first step in the process is installing ROS 2 Galactic. 
  * You should have done this in the prior lesson.
* We will also need three ROS tools, `colcon-common-extensions`, `rosdep`, and `vcs`
* `colcon-common-extensions` are add-ons to the ROS build tool Colcon
* `rosdep` is a python tool for managing ROS dependencies. 
* `vcs` is a Python tool that automates checking out and updating collections of repositories.
* You can verify that these tools are installed using `pip list | grep vcstool`


## Inst

![Shapes Demo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/47/IRobotCreate.jpg)

* [Follow installation directions from iRobot](https://github.com/iRobotEducation/create3_sim/blob/main/README.md#prerequisites)
* Create a workspace if you don't already have one.
* Clone the Create 3 repository into the src directory.
* Navigate to the workspace and install ROS 2 dependencies 

```

mkdir -p ~/create3_ws/src
vcs import ~/create3_ws/src/ < ~/create3_ws/src/create3_sim/dependencies.repos
cd ~/create3_ws
rosdep install --from-path src -yi
colcon build --symlink-install
source install/local_setup.bash
```
